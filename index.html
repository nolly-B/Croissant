    <h1>🥐CROISSANT</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃] (listen)) is a buttery, flaky,
      viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but
      using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[1][better source needed]
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is
      layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
      rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
      results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
